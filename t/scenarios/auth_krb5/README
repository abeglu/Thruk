== Kerberos Setup

to manually reproduce things here you need to:

  - connect by vnc either by
    - vnc 127.0.0.3:5901
    - http://127.0.0.3:6901/
    - password is "vncpassword" (you can use the link: http://127.0.0.3:6901/?password=vncpassword )
  - open firefox and connect to: https://omd.test.local/demo/


This setup looks like this:

  +-----+      +------+       +------------+
  |     | vnc  |      |       |            |
  | VNC +----->+ OMD  +------>+ Remote OMD |
  |     | http |      | https |            |
  +-+---+      +-+----+       +-+----------+
    ^           ^               |
    |krb        |krb            |krb
    |           |               |
  +-+-----------+-+             |
  |               |             |
  | Kerberos Host +<------------+
  |               |
